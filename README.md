### _INTRODUCTION_
The Delivery Genix is developed in consideration to the demands of most consumers exchanging goods through different courier companies. The app chooses the best courier company based on the factors affecting your delivery & ensures that only the best company is chosed to delivery goods. <br> 

### _PROBLEM STATEMENTS_
1. **Shorter distance, faster delivery** <br>
The application will analyse five
(5) local courier companies which have their delivery hubs located in various locations in West Malaysia. Each parel passes through a hub. Plot the shortest parcel route of all three customer passing the hub taking the shortest time
   

2. **Higher review, greater quality service** <br>
Shorter distance travelled does not mean that the courier company is the most
recommended option for customer to use. A sentiment analysis of the related news articles about the
courier company must be conducted.
   

3. **Final Analytic Conclusion** <br>
Customers need to be able to choose the best courier company based on the distance as well
as the result of sentiment analysis of related online articles.
   

4. **DTW CONCEPT** (NOT IMPLEMENT)<br>
Assuming that video or audio from the news or customer feedback will be used to provide
sentiment insights in the future, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is one of the algorithms that can
potentially be used
